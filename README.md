## Description
* A social app for language learners!
* Each user who signs up has the capability to post if they are studying, and where they are studying.
* Other users can check the map if there are any other language learners who are studying.
* MVC Design Pattern

## Frameworks
* UIKit
* CoreLocation
* MapKit
* Firebase
* IQKeyboardManagerSwift

# What I Learned
* Utilizing Firebase Authentication, Database, and Storage.
* Touched on Firebase Cloud Functions to provide remote user notifications; will revisit in the future.
* Using xib models to display table view cells.
* Using UIPicker to select media.
* The structure would be better suited if it is organized using an MVVM pattern with singleton managers; currently in progress.
